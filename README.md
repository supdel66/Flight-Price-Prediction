# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction (ML Prototype)

A machine learning-based project to predict flight ticket prices based on features like airline, source, destination, duration, etc.  
Currently implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, this is the prototype stage for a future full-stack product.

---

## 📓 Current Status

✅ **Prototype Phase**: Built and evaluated a regression model in a Jupyter Notebook to predict flight prices based on structured data.

🔜 **Planned Development**:
- Turn model into a REST API using Flask or FastAPI
- Build a frontend UI with React or Next.js
- Deploy as a full-stack web app
